<div style="text-align: justify;">
Women in Mathematics and Computer Science (WiMCS) is set to become an official Community Group at Swansea University, dedicated to increasing the number of women pursuing studies or research in the Mathematics and Computer Science Department. The WiMCS group will organize a mentorship program, host career and research-focused events, and provide networking opportunities that connect women in the early stages of their academic careers with mentorship and support.

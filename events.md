WiMACS welcomes people at different stages of their careers or studies! Through mentorship programs, career and research focused events, and networking opportunities, we help connect women in the early stages of their academic journey with valuable guidance and support. Meanwhile, we are always seeking student volunteers interested in becoming leaders and assisting in organizing WiMACS events for the upcoming events. We also welcome collaborations with other universities! Please feel free to email us for further details on collaboration opportunities.
